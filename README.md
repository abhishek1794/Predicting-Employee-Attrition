# Predicting-Employee-Attrition
It was a classification problem to predict whether employee is retiring/ resigning (Attrition) the company. The dataset consisted of 35 features and around 3k entries. Performed EDA it was known that some features like Overtime, monthly income, martial status, etc.,  were highly affecting attrition. Used SMOTE (Over sampling) for balancing the attrition data and built KNN model to predict the attrition. Recall score was chosen as a metric for calculating accuracy.
	We were able to to predict the attrition and get the insights from the data about the important factors associated with the attrition
Key skills: Data pre-processing, SMOTE, KNN
